## How to use

Anime Discord RPC can be easily used by simply installing the extension and linking your Discord account.

**If you use Firefox (Desktop & Android):**
It's super easy! Just go to the [Firefox Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anikoto-discord-rpc/) and click **"Add to Firefox"**.

**If you use Chrome (Desktop):**
We aren't in the Chrome Web Store just yet, so follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/minkxx/anime-discord-rpc/releases) and download `anime-rpc-extension-2.2.2-chrome.zip`.
2. **Extract (unzip)** that file into a regular folder on your computer.
3. Open Google Chrome and type `chrome://extensions` into the top web address bar and press Enter.
4. Look at the top-right corner of the screen and turn **ON** the switch for **Developer mode**.
5. Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears on the top left.
6. Select the folder you just unzipped. You're done!

**If you use an Android Mobile Device (via Kiwi Browser):**
You can use this extension on the go by using an Android browser that supports Chrome extensions, such as Kiwi Browser or Lemur Browser.

1. Install `Kiwi Browser` from the Google Play Store.
2. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/minkxx/anime-discord-rpc/releases) and download `anime-rpc-extension-2.2.2-chrome.zip` to your phone.
3. Open Kiwi Browser, tap the three dots menu (⋮) in the top right, and select **Extensions**.
4. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle at the top right.
5. Tap the **+ (from .zip/.crx/.user.js)** button and select the downloaded `.zip` file from your device storage.
6. Open the extension from the bottom of the three dots menu!

---

**Link your Discord:** Open the extension popup from your browser toolbar (or menu) and click **Link with Discord**. You will be redirected to Discord's secure OAuth2 authorization page to authorize the application.

**Start watching:** Open an episode on any supported site, and your Discord rich presence will automatically update!

## v2 - The Native Update

Anime Discord RPC has been completely rebuilt from the ground up! **Version 2 is now a standalone browser extension built with [WXT](https://wxt.dev/)**. 

* **No More Desktop App:** We have completely removed the Electron desktop middleware. 
* **Native WebSockets:** The extension now authenticates via Discord OAuth2 and connects directly to Discord's Gateway via WebSockets natively right from your browser background worker. 
* **Better UI:** Features a sleek new React-based popup built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.

## Features

* **Rich Presence:** Displays Anime Title, Episode, and dynamic Watch/Paused states.
* **Live Progress:** Shows real-time progress bars, elapsed time, and time remaining using Discord timestamps.
* **Mobile Support:** Fully functional on Android extension-supported browsers with a custom mobile OAuth authentication flow.
* **Cover Art:** Automatically fetches high-quality cover art. Includes fallback support to the AniList GraphQL API for sites with protected assets (e.g., AnimePahe).
* **Privacy Toggle:** Instantly toggle presence broadcasting on or off from the popup without needing to log out of Discord.
* **Zero Overhead:** Completely contained within your browser with no background desktop apps required.
